Software to calculate the space ocupied by files and folders

I created this thing to calculate the space ocupied by all my games and software setups on my hard drives, now it also reads information on OneDrive. 
As my setups have been split in RAR Parts of 100MB, it also recognise the folder of a software and calculate the space based on total of space of all RAR Parts.
